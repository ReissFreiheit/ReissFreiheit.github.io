        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m a 4th year Human Centered Computing student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I was originally studying computer science, but I was frequently more concerned with how someone was using a system rather than the system itself.</p>

        <p>My interests in UX are currently focused on the field of AR and VR. It excites me that user interactions and experiences are no longer limited to a flat screen, but now focus on more spatial experiences. I want to make an impact in UX, and I feel that these new virtual spaces are the perfect place to do so.</p>
