                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Games Workshop owns multiple tabletop miniature games that utilize their Citadel brand of miniatures. These tabletop games have amassed a large following in the decades following their inception. Games Workshop released a Warhammer Community website a couple years ago. This website focuses on delivering news about upcoming releases and events associated with the brand. With this website Games Workshop has an opportunity to connect their loyal fans to their brands and the communities that surround them.</p>

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>There is no central location for fans of Games Workshop products to interact, either with the company or each other. Most fans congregate on social media or blog websites. How might we make interacting with the Warhammer Community a more rewarding and valued experience for fans?</p>

                <h2>Interaction</h2>
                <h3>Interaction Exploration</h3>
                <p>Design focused on how a user would interact with the app and arrive at features. A basic Lofi prototype helped flesh these ideas out.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Some ideas got cut for complexity, but they can be incorporated into an update further down the line.</p>
                <h3>Design Direction</h3>
                <p>In order to ideate for a cohesive design, moodboards were created</p>

                    <img src="images/dark.png">
                </div>
                <p>Feedback on the moodboards resulted in the experimental dark theme being chosen, mainly because it allowed the images in the app, the main content, to come forward.</p>

                <h2>Design Round</h2>
                <p>A fully visualized solution was presented and feedback was generated. Most of the comments were focused on the low contrast and general dark feeling of the app.</p>

                <p>I created a Warhammer Community app that allows fans to interact with one another and the hobby easily. Fans can: - view a news feed direct from Games Workshop on the latest updates for the miniature ranges - organize narrative campaigns and tournaments - connect with other fans through their Games Workshop accounts.</p>
