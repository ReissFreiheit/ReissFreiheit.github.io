            <h1>Surface Problem Solving for Introductory Computer Science</h1>

            <h2>Intended work of the study</h2>

            <p>This independent study was aimed at exploring the viability and potential application of Microsoft Surface devices in introductory computer science class workshops. I intended to test the submission and application of workshop materials from both the student and professor perspectives. The initial plan was to figure out a way to apply the OneNote software that comes preinstalled on the Surface devices to the introductory computer science problem solving sessions that occur before that week’s lab is assigned. If this OneNote solution proved equal to or better than the current methods for problem solving, then this study will have been a success.</p>

            <h2>Previous methods for problem solving (and the issues associated)</h2>

            <p>Pen and Paper: The pen and paper method for computer science problem solving sessions is the “tried and true” method. The obvious advantage to this method is that everyone knows how to do an assignment by pen and paper. Nothing needs to be explained, the students just get to work. There are three main problems with this method. The first is that if the student loses their graded work after class, there is no way for them to recover that work when working on the respective lab or to study from for an exam. Admittedly, it is up to the student to be organized, but if systems used by the class can assist in that effort, all the better. The second issue is that the pen and paper method requires the professors to print out many copies of the problem-solving worksheets. This is contrast to RIT’s efforts to become more sustainable. Following that point, the third issue is that the professor needs to gather up all the worksheets and leave the lab to grade them. This leaves the SLI’s entirely in charge and if a problem were to arise that they could not answer, the best response they can give to the students is, “wait for the professor to return”.</p>

            <p>Whiteboard: The whiteboard method is relatively new to problem-solving. The main advantage to this method is the collaborative aspect. Since there is one whiteboard per group, the entire group can write on it. There are two important disadvantages that need to be addressed. The first is the lack of permanence. The only way for the students to hold on to the work they did during class is to take a picture of the whiteboard. This again relies on the student to organize. The second issue is that the professor grades these whiteboards on the spot and with no record. The professor must remember the groups and their grades. There is too much room for human error in this method.</p>

            <h2>Research on OneNote</h2>

            <p>OneNote is an easy to use note making tool included on every Surface device. The Surface pen works seamlessly in the app because the two were basically made for each other. Initially, I considered how easily it would be to just drop the current problem solving worksheets into OneNote. OneNote turns any document into an image in its interface so that it is easy to write over it with the pen. This turned out to mimic the pen and paper method quite easily, so any transition from using the Surface devices from using pen and paper should go smoothly. Many problem-solving activities require the students to draw diagrams that have already been shown on the document provided. The ability to just copy and paste the diagrams instead of redrawing them over and over saves time and allows the students to get to the actual work of filling these diagrams in. Overall, OneNote provides a very similar writing experience to the pen and paper method, but with some added digital tools.</p>

            <h2>OneNote Online and OneNote Class Notebook</h2>

            <p>OneNote on its own would have been difficult, as there was no way to link students’ notebooks together with professors’ notebooks. OneNote Class Notebook and OneNote Online solve this issue quite nicely. While this solution does require an Office 365 account, these are free for faculty and students, or anyone with a rit.edu email. Professors can easily create notebooks and then add their students to them through the OneNote Online interface. Once the students are added, anything that they create in their section of the notebook is saved there until they delete it. They cannot lose their work without purposeful action. Furthermore, they can access this content in their browser from anywhere. No more paper required for problem solving. Professors can see all the content that is in the class notebook, whereas students can only see their own section and the sections that the professor has made available to them. This ensures students cannot share their personal work in this interface.</p>

            <p>The OneNote Class Notebook sections can be opened in the OneNote application on the Surface devices. This allows professors to grade the assignments as groups submit them during the problem-solving class time. The professor can even watch the work being done by the students as they do it, because the notebook updates only a few minutes after edits are made to a document.</p>
