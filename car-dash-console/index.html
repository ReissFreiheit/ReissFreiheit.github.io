                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In summer 2018, I led a project about car interfaces for the RIT UX Club. We collaborated on everything from competitive analysis to user research. Everyone who participated created their own designs using the ideas and data we collected together. We looked at lots of different tasks and situations that relate to driving, from adjusting the temperature to how driving a car compares to piloting an airplane.</p>

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Car manufacturers have long had touchscreens in their higher end models. As touchscreens become standard in every vehicle, it has become more apparent that the manufacturers have looked to mobile and tablet designs for inspiration. This is an error and ignores best practices when designing for an interface used by a driver.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The project started by just asking questions. What sort of data can help inform how drivers use their center consoles and dashboards?</p>
                <img src="images/notes.png"
                <p>Eventually we settled on four main research questions:  What functions of the center console do you use most?  What functions of the dashboard do you use most?  Do you prefer buttons/knobs to touchscreens?  What applications are on your phone while driving?</p>
                <p>A survey was created and sent out to both the club and reddit. We got over 300 responses. This allowed us to get a better insight into how people used their cars and the interfaces surrounding their driving experience.</p>

                <p>Once we had gathered the data, we split off to create our own designs.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The majority of responses came back with drivers preferring analog over touchscreen, but not by a wide margin. My belief is that the car manufacturers have not treated touchscreens correctly in cars, and so drivers find them annoying or distracting. I attempted to combine analog and touchscreen controls where it made sense.  While the screens are large, they would be OLED to allow for a dark, minimal distraction, night mode. This would allow drivers to still get the benefits of touchscreens without having miniature floodlights inside their car.</p>

                <p>Designing based on data is fun, but I was a bit in over my head here. While I'm happy with how my design turned out, I didn't familiarize myself enough with everything that a driver can do from a car console, so I definitely missed some things. If I were to go back to this project, I would fully map out every button and option available in a car and make user flows based on those. This would allow my design to better fit to life.</p>
