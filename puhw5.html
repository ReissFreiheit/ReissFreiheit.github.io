        <p>5 separate participants completed the usability test. Participants were asked to complete 4 tasks, varying from simply navigating the prototype to making certain elements disappear. At the end of the test they were asked to fill out a SUS(system usability scale). The SUS is scored from 0-100, with scores above 68 being considered "above average". Their scores are as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Participant</th>
                <th>Score</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>P1</td>
                <td>80</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>P2</td>
                <td>70</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>P3</td>
                <td>82.5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>P4</td>
                <td>97.5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>P5</td>
                <td>95</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>For the most part, participants did not have trouble completing the tasks. The green favorite indicator did seem to cause some confusion among users. Many users though it was the way to open/close the items, but that was simply a mistake in the prototype. The system allows too many errors at the moment. Some sort of secondary confirmation for unfavoriting an item should be added to ensure users don't mistakenly unfavorite items when trying to close them.</p>
